        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We are Kalobe and Sonia Monroy-Selu, the founders of Socials by Selu. We are dreamers with a
            vision—everything we do is for our children and to build the life we’ve always dreamed of for them. Our goal
            is simple: to provide the best life possible for our family while spending every precious moment together.
            That’s why we’ve started this business. We believe in working hard to earn back our time and live life on
            our own terms, sharing our journey with those who value freedom, family, and growth.</p>

        <h2>Why We Started Socials by Selu</h2>
        <p>We created Socials by Selu because we wanted to change the way we live and work. We have an entrepreneurial
            mindset that drives us to build a business around our lifestyle, giving us the flexibility to be there for
            our kids and loved ones while doing meaningful work. By combining Sonia’s business expertise and Kalobe’s
            sales background, we’re passionate about helping businesses grow through creative, tailored social media
            strategies that produce real results.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt> <strong>Sonia Monroy-Selu</strong></dt>
            <dd>Sonia’s background comes from managing a family-owned preschool, where she learned the power of creating
                a safe, nurturing space for families. She excelled at running the business, refining processes, and
                developing high-quality curriculums. But Sonia knew there was more to life than just working; she wanted
                to focus on her passions, from reading books to scrapbooking, all while having more time to spend with
                her family. That’s why she decided to pursue social media marketing at Utah Valley University,
                sharpening her skills and preparing for the next chapter.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Kalobe Selu</strong></dt>
            <dd>Kalobe’s journey led him through sports and sales, discovering his true passion for serving others.
                Through his experience in sports software sales, he’s learned the value of helping people find solutions
                that make their lives easier. But while Kalobe loves serving clients, he knew he wanted the freedom to
                shape his day and spend more time on the things that matter most—like weekly basketball games,
                slow-paced runs, and family moments.</dd>
